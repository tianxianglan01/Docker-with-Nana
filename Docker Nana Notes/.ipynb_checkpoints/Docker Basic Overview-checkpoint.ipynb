    "What is a container?\n",
    "- A way to package application wtih all necessary dependencies and configurations\n",
    "- package is portable, can be easily shared or moved around\n",
    "- makes development and deployment more efficient\n",
    "\n",
    "Where do containers live?\n",
    "- containers live in a container repository (special container for containers)\n",
    "- private repositories: where companies host or store containers\n",
    "- public repository: can browse and find any application you want on dockerhub\n",

    "- many steps where something could go wrong\n",
    "\n",
    "After Containers\n",
    "- do not have to install any services on your own operating system \n",
    "- the container is its own isolated environment\n",
    "- packaged with all needed configs. So Postgres SQL of a specific version is packaged with configs in the start script inside of one container\n",
    "- developer checks out container repository to find specific container and download on local machine\n",

    "What is an image?\n",
    "- a docker image is a file used to execute code in a docker container. They act as a set of instructions to build a docker container. So I guess a redis image is a series of instructions that build a container for the red "

    "- How is an operating System made up?\n",
    "\n",
    "Os have two layers: the OS Kernel and the Application\n",
    "- the kernel is the part with hardware such as CPU and memory\n",
    "- the applications run on the kernel layer where the application is the app itself\n",
    "- ie Linux OS has many different versions. Even though they use the same linux kernel, they have many different applications on top of that kernel\n",
    "\n",
    "- docker and virtual machines are both virtualizaiton tools\n",
    "The Question becomes: What parts of the OS do they (docker or vm) virtualize?\n",
    "- docker virtualizes the applications layer\n",
    "- when you download a docker image, it contains the applications layer of the OS, and it uses the kernel of the host because it doesn't have its own kernel \n",
    "- a VM has an application layer and its own kernel and virtualizes its complete OS\n",
    "- when you download a vm on your host, it doesn't use its host kernel. It boots up its own. Right because a virtual machine is run from a server with its own kernel. If you were to run an application from your local machine, you would use YOUR OWN kernel\n",
    "\n",
    "So the difference between docker and vm means!!\n",
    "- size of docker images are much smaller because they need to implement 1 layer. are a couple mb. vms can be a couple of gbs\n",
    "- speed: docker containers start and run much faster cause you have to boot OS kernel\n",
    "- compatibility: you can run a vm image on any os host (run a windows on a macbook pro or a linux etc)\n",
    "\n",
    "So what's the problem?\n",
    "- you have a windows OS host and want to run a linux based docker image. The linux based docker image might not be compatible with a windows kernel. This is true for older windows versions and mac versions.\n",
    "- you need to first check if your host can run docker natively\n",
    "- which means is your kernel compatible with docker images?\n",
    "- the workaround is to install docker toolbox which abstracts away kernel to make possible for host to run different docker images"
